                                The world is facing a growing e-waste problem. The amount of e-waste generated each year is increasing at an alarming rate, and the ammount of E-waste recycled is having a minimal impact.
                                According to a report from Statista, over 50 million metric tons of E-waste is generated globally every year, and what's worse is that only around 17% is of generated E-waste is properly recycled.

                                                In 2021, a staggering 57.4 million metric tonnes (Mt) of electronic waste (e-waste) was generated globally, with the total amount growing by an average of 2 Mt annually. Despite efforts to recycle and properly dispose of e-waste, over 347 Mt of unrecycled e-waste remains on Earth as of 2023. China, the United States, and India are the largest producers of e-waste, contributing significantly to the global total. Shockingly, only 17.4% of e-waste is known to be collected and properly recycled, which is a cause for concern. Estonia, Norway, and Iceland are currently leading the charge in e-waste recycling rates, with the highest percentages of e-waste being recycled in these countries.

                                                The e-waste recycling market was valued at $49,880 million in 2020, indicating a growing awareness of the need for proper e-waste management. However, since data collection began in 2014, an estimated total of 420.3 million metric tonnes of e-waste have been produced, with only a small percentage of that being recycled. This number is likely an underestimation as there is no record of e-waste produced before 2014. In addition, recycling rates have varied over the years and may have been lower initially, before global awareness of the issue was raised, and more countries introduced legislation to enable proper recycling. A report released by Reports Insights earleir this year suggests that the E-waste management market will be growing at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2022 to 2030, meaning that the market is estimated to exceed USD 67.1 Billion by 2030 from a worth of USD 50.9 Billion in 2022.

                                                An estimated 44.4 million metric tons of unwanted "e-waste," such as battery- or plug-tethered electronics including computers, smartphones, and televisions, were dumped globally in 2014. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor 2020, that amount is anticipated to increase to around 74.7 million tons by 2030. Eight times the weight of China's Three Gorges Dam would roughly be the comparison. The International Solid Waste Association, the International Telecommunication Union, and other organizations collaborated to track the buildup of electronic waste, and their conclusions are the result of that collaboration. The anticipated e-waste for 2020 and other years does not take into account any potential economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                                                Global electronic waste volume is projected to grow to 74.7 Mt by 2030, indicating a doubling of the current volume in only 16 years. The global e-waste generation has increased by 2 Mt annually over the last decade, making this projection a likely outcome. Therefore, it is critical to consider the impact that this projected increase in e-waste will have on the environment, economy, and society.

                    <h2>E-waste has plagued and polluted our world for far too long! Help us recycle as much as possible and save the earth from this crisis

                    The main problem with E-waste is that there is just too much of it. Millions of tons of E-waste are globally produced annually, and most of it ends up being left for scrap,
                    burned with fire, processed by hand through inappropriate methods, or illegally dumped in places where they cannot be recovered. The inappropriate disposal methods of E-waste
                    cause severe environmental damage since E-waste contains toxic chemicals that can poison the soil and water, and, if processed by hand, can pollute the air and cause severe
                    health issues by inhaling its fumes, including cancers, miscarriages, brain damage, liver damage, and other illnesses.
