                                E-waste is a big problem because it is not properly disposed of. Most of theE-waste is left for scrap, burned with fire, processed by hand through inappropriate methods, or illegally dumped in places where they cannot be recovered. The inappropriate disposal methods of E-waste cause severe environmental damage since E-waste contains toxic chemicals that can poison the soil and water, and, if processed by hand, can pollute the air and cause severe health issues by inhaling its fumes, including cancers, miscarriages, brain damage, liver damage, and other illnesses.

                                            People can reduce the amount of e-waste produced by reducing the number of electronic devices produced in the first place.
                                            There is no need to upgrade to a new phone or a new computer each year when people already have an electronic product that can be used for the next 3 to 5 years. Instead of leaving
                                            unwanted but usable products for scrap, people can sell them or donate them to other people who may need them

                                            As mentioned before, E-waste contains toxic chemicals that are dangerous for people and the environment.
                                            For example, burning electronics can result in the release of dangerous fumes, which pollutes the air and causes detrimental health issues for people who inhale it. Instead of relying on such methods,
                                            people could rely on a more environmentally friendly method to dispose of electronics that have reached the end of their life cycle, like sending them to a designated e-waste recycling facility that
                                            recycles e-waste and recovers precious metal such as gold, silver, copper, etc.
