                                E-waste is a big problem because it is not properly disposed of. Most of theE-waste is left for scrap, burned with fire, processed by hand through inappropriate methods, or illegally dumped in places where they cannot be recovered. The inappropriate disposal methods of E-waste cause severe environmental damage since E-waste contains toxic chemicals that can poison the soil and water, and, if processed by hand, can pollute the air and cause severe health issues by inhaling its fumes, including cancers, miscarriages, brain damage, liver damage, and other illnesses.

                        <p class="ms-3">
                            The world is facing a growing e-waste problem. The amount of e-waste generated each year is increasing at an alarming rate, and the amount of e-waste that is recycled is not keeping up. The United Nations University (UNU) estimates that 20-50 million metric tons of e-waste is generated each year, and that only 20-50% of it is recycled. The rest is either dumped in landfills or burned, releasing toxic chemicals into the environment. The UNU also estimates that the amount of e-waste generated each year will increase to 52-74 million metric tons by 2021. This is a huge problem, and it is only getting worse.

                                            In 2021, a staggering 57.4 million metric tonnes (Mt) of electronic waste (e-waste) was generated globally, with the total amount growing by an average of 2 Mt annually. Despite efforts to recycle and properly dispose of e-waste, over 347 Mt of unrecycled e-waste remains on Earth as of 2023. China, the United States, and India are the largest producers of e-waste, contributing significantly to the global total. Shockingly, only 17.4% of e-waste is known to be collected and properly recycled, which is a cause for concern. Estonia, Norway, and Iceland are currently leading the charge in e-waste recycling rates, with the highest percentages of e-waste being recycled in these countries.

However, since data collection began in 2014, an estimated total of 420.3 million metric tonnes of e-waste have been produced, with only a small percentage of that being recycled. This number is likely an underestimation as there is no record of e-waste produced before 2014. In addition, recycling rates have varied over the years and may have been lower initially, before global awareness of the issue was raised, and more countries introduced legislation to enable proper recycling.
