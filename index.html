        <h2>What is E-waste?</h2>

        <p>The term E-Waste refers to any electronic products or equipment that have outlived their usefulness. For example, broken old phones, TVs, computers, printers, faxes,
             and many other electronics that are no longer needed or deemed useless. E-waste contains bits of precious metal such as gold, copper, silver, palladium, and nickel, 
             which could be retrieved when processed properly.</p>

        <h2>Why is it such a big problem?</h2>

        <p>The main problem with E-waste is that there is just too much of it. Millions of tons of E-waste are globally produced annually, and most of it ends up being left for scrap,
             burned with fire, processed by hand through inappropriate methods, or illegally dumped in places where they cannot be recovered. The inappropriate disposal methods of E-waste
              cause severe environmental damage since E-waste contains toxic chemicals that can poison the soil and water, and, if processed by hand, can pollute the air and cause severe
               health issues by inhaling its fumes, including cancers, miscarriages, brain damage, liver damage, and other illnesses.</p>

        <h2>Are there any solutions to this issue?</h2>

        <p> Of course! There are many solutions that can help reduce the impact of E-waste.
            <ul>
                <li><h2>Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle</h2>
                    <p>People can reduce the amount of e-waste produced by reducing the number of electronic devices produced in the first place.
                        There is no need to upgrade to a new phone or a new computer each year when people already have an electronic product that can be used for the next 3 to 5 years. Instead of leaving
                         unwanted but usable products for scrap, people can sell them or donate them to other people who may need them.</p></li>

                <li><h2>Don't just abandon it! give it a new home and purpose</h2><p>As mentioned before, E-waste contains toxic chemicals that are dangerous for people and the environment.
                    For example, burning electronics can result in the release of dangerous fumes, which pollutes the air and causes detrimental health issues for people who inhale it. Instead of relying on such methods,
                     people could rely on a more environmentally friendly method to dispose of electronics that have reached the end of their life cycle, like sending them to a designated e-waste recycling facility that
                      recycles e-waste and recovers precious metal such as gold, silver, copper, etc.</p></li>

                      <li><h2>Beware and Educate</h2><p>Raising awareness about the problem of e-waste and educating consumers about the proper disposal methods of electronics that are no longer usable, as well as the
                         detrimental impacts that result from handling e-waste inappropriately.</p></li>

                <li><h2>Time for the government to step up!</h2><p>Enforcing government laws and policies that ensure the proper disposal of e-waste, and fining anyone who violates those laws. Governments may resort to a similar solution because raising
                         awareness and educating consumers about the proper methods of handling e-waste may not be enough by itself.</p></li>
            </ul>
